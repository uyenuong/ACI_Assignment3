This is for the third project for Art, Code and Interactivity, which is to create a code poem.

My poem is about an unskilled laborer, making minimum wage and working hard to pay the bills while trying to save up money for retirement. Only when the worker has saved up $1 million can they retire, which could take longer than the average lifespan and they might die before then from a heart attack. The program similates this tough lifestyle that is often overlooked and underappreciated.

To run, download both Poem.c and WorkFunction.h.
